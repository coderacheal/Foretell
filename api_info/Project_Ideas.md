## Project Ideas you can analyse using the World Bank API

Analyzing cross-functional topics using multiple World Bank databases can provide valuable insights into complex issues that intersect various aspects of development and economics. Here are some cross-functional topics you can explore by integrating data from at least three of the World Bank [databases](/api_info/Availble_databases.md)

### A few thing to note, whatever topic you select to analyse, you have to 
 - Select a geographic region (this can be a country or continent, or an economic zone)
 - Select a time for the analysis (this can be a year, 10years a particular time period, and economic event(in years), political, etc so far as there is that data available by the World Bank)
  
## Project Ideas

1. **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Progress:** Use data from the World Development Indicators (WDI), Climate Change Knowledge Portal, and Education Statistics to assess a country's progress toward achieving specific SDGs. For example, you can analyze data on GDP growth, greenhouse gas emissions, and education access to evaluate how economic development intersects with climate action and education outcomes.

2. **Gender Inequality and Economic Development:** Combine Gender Data, World Development Indicators (WDI), and Labor Market Indicators to study the relationship between gender inequality and economic development. Analyze indicators like gender wage gaps, female labor force participation, and women's access to education and healthcare.

3. **Rural Development and Agriculture:** Utilize data from Agriculture and Rural Development, Infrastructure Data, and Poverty and Equity Data to examine rural development challenges. Explore how investment in rural infrastructure, access to agricultural resources, and poverty rates in rural areas are interconnected.

4. **Financial Inclusion and Poverty Alleviation:** Combine Global Findex data, Poverty and Equity Data, and Enterprise Surveys to study the impact of financial inclusion on poverty reduction and economic development. Analyze how access to financial services, particularly for microenterprises, influences income levels and poverty rates.

5. **Healthcare Access and Human Capital Development:** Use Health Nutrition and Population (HNP) Data, Education Statistics, and Urban Development and Housing Data to investigate the relationship between access to healthcare and educational outcomes in urban areas. Assess the impact of healthcare infrastructure on human capital development.

6. **Private Sector Investment in Infrastructure and Economic Growth:** Combine Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) Database, Infrastructure Data, and Trade Data to assess the role of private sector investment in infrastructure projects in promoting economic growth and international trade.

7. **Labor Market and Social Protection:** Utilize Labor Market Indicators, Social Protection and Labor Database, and World Development Indicators (WDI) to analyze how labor market conditions and social protection programs influence poverty rates and income distribution.

8. **Urbanization and Environmental Sustainability:** Combine Urban Development and Housing Data, Climate Change Knowledge Portal, and Infrastructure Data to study the environmental impact of rapid urbanization. Analyze how urban planning and infrastructure development affect carbon emissions and sustainability.

These are just a few examples of cross-functional topics you can explore by integrating data from multiple World Bank databases. The key is to identify the relationships between different aspects of development and use data-driven analysis to inform policy recommendations and decision-making.
